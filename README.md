Update 2022-07-17: SNKR website has been updated leading the product scrapping to fail.

# SNKRScraper-GoogleCal
Bot that scrapes SNKR.com's upcoming drops and searches for selling price data on stockX.com to determine if drops are worth re-selling. If a drop is found to be profitable, the bot will create a Google calendar. Comments are left within the code to indicate where to fill in necessary data.

## "Security Feature" (Actually a bug):
- Somtimes when token expires, it needs to be deleted in order to run the program again and it will refresh the token.
