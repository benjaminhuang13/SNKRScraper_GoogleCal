# SNKRScraper-GoogleCal
Scraper that scrapes SNKR.com's upcoming drops and searches up stockX.com's data to determine if drops are worth reselling. If profitable, a google calendar event is created.

Comments are left within the code to fill in necessary data.

Bugs/Features:
- when token expires, it needs to be deleted in order to run the program again and refresh the token
